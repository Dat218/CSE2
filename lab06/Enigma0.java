/* Error report:
 *   Expand this comment:
 *   The scope of the program was inaccurate. n was declared and initialized inside the if and else statemnet. 
 *   Therefore, when n is called for again in the switch statement, it could not be found. 
 *   This issue was solved by declaring n in the very beginning of the program
 *   It allowed for n to run through the loop and equal one of the given numbers and be printed out at the end.
